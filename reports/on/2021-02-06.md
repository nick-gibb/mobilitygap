**Figure 1.** The non-residential mobility index is a measure of the average amount of time spent outside of home, based on smartphone mobility data (the index is scaled so that levels in the baseline period from January 3rd to February 6th, 2020 represent 100).

Weekly COVID-19 growth rate (Y = cases in given week / cases in prior week) is strongly associated with the non-residential mobility in the prior 2-week period (X). The point where the regression line (black) crosses the line representing no COVID-19 case growth (red line) is the average Canadian mobility threshold. The Canadian mobility threshold is lower in spring, fall and winter of 2020, compared to the summer of 2020.

The mobility threshold is the estimated level of mobility needed to control COVID-19 case growth. This threshold is highest in summer and in less populated provinces. When mobility decreased below the mobility threshold (blue dots), weekly COVID-19 cases counts decreased. In November 2020, Manitoba was the only province that implemented a lockdown that had successfully crossed the mobility threshold and has led to reductions in COVID-19 case growth. Other provinces waited until December 2020.
